# Django Backend Guidelines

- Run all Django commands inside the container (`docker compose exec backend {command}`)
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code
- Use Django's ORM for database operations
- Implement proper error handling with try/except blocks
- Write comprehensive tests for all functionality
- Document all functions, classes, and modules with docstrings
- Ensure API endpoints include validation and proper error responses
- Keep database migrations in version control

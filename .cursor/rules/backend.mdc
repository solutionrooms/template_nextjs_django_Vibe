#You are an expert in Python, Django, and scalable API development.

#Key Principles
- Django and postgres database are running in docker containers. do not try to run django commands locally, instead only run them inside containers.
- the code will be tested locally but the production containers will always run on a remote server which will be updated with a git pull (or equivalent). This means that all migrations should be available as code for example.

#Dependencies
  - Django
  - Postgresql

#References
- Refer to Django documentation for Data Models, Path Operations, and Middleware for best practices.

You are an expert in Next.js

Code Style and Structure

- Write concise, technical TypeScript code with accurate examples.
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
- Prefer iteration and modularization over code duplication.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`).
- Structure files with exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.
- Favor named exports for components and functions.
- Use lowercase with dashes for directory names (e.g., `components/auth-wizard`).

Syntax and Formatting

- Use the `function` keyword for pure functions.
- Write declarative JSX with clear and readable structure.
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements.

Error Handling and Validation

- Prioritize error handling and edge cases.
- Handle errors and edge cases at the beginning of functions.
- Use early returns for error conditions to avoid deep nesting.
- Utilize guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
- Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
- Use custom error types or factories for consistent error handling.

Performance Optimization

- Optimize for both web and mobile performance.
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting in Next.js.
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical components.
- Optimize images use appropriate formats, include size data, and implement lazy loading.

Backend

- Use API for backend services, including authentication and database interactions.


Project Structure and Environment

- Follow the established project structure with separate packages for `app`, `ui`, and `api`.
- Use the `apps` directory for Next.js and Expo applications.
- Utilize the `packages` directory for shared code and components.
- Use `dotenv` for environment variable management.
- Follow patterns for environment-specific configurations in `eas.json` and `next.config.js`.
- Utilize custom generators in `turbo/generators` for creating components, screens, and tRPC routers using `yarn turbo gen`.

Follow Official Documentation

- Adhere to the official documentation for each technology used.
- For Next.js, focus on data fetching methods and routing conventions.
- Stay updated with the latest best practices and updates, especially for Expo, Tamagui, and Supabase.

# Next.js Frontend Guidelines

- Run all Node.js/npm commands inside the container (`docker compose exec frontend {command}`)
- Use functional components and hooks; avoid classes
- Write concise TypeScript code with proper typing
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., `isLoading`, `hasError`)
- Handle errors at the beginning of functions using early returns
- Implement proper error handling and user-friendly error messages
- Optimize for performance with code splitting and lazy loading
- Follow established project structure for components, pages, and styles

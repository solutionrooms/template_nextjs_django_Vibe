# principles
- only run django inside backend container. i.e. "docker compose exec backend {command}" never run it locally outside the container.
- only run npm or any node commands inside of the frontend container. e.g. "docker compose exec frontend {command}" never run it locally outside the container.
- The code needs to be portable to a remote server. So the containers must be self-contained and not rely on any locally compiled code, so it can be built and deployed anywhere.
